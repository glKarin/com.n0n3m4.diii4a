ioUrbanTerror is not a Frozen Sand product and is not part of Urban Terror. It's a seperate 3rd party product by woekele.

ioUrbanTerror can be used instead of Quake 3 Arena to run Urban Terror 4.x on.

If you already own a full copy of Quake 3 Arena and want to continue using Punkbuster, you don't need ioUrbanTerror and can install/use Quake 3 Arena + Urban Terror. If you don't have Quake 3 Arena and/or don't care about Punkbuster, then you should use ioUrbanTerror. Don't forget to install Urban Terror 4.x after installing ioUrbanTerror.

A word of thanks to:
-The ioquake3 team, for providing a very good code base to work on.
-Hobbes, for helping me out a lot with creating this software.
-Nexu, helping out a lot as well.
-Illogical, for providing a very good looking logo.
-Frozen Sand, for creating Urban Terror and all the fun that comes with it.

Created by woekele. You should be able to reach me at #urbanterror on irc.enterthegame.com.
