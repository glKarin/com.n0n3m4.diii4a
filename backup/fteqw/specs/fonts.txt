FTE supports ttf fonts on the console.
Note that they are only supported in gl-only builds, for the moment.
Uses freetype2, dynamically linked.

Notes:
Use gl_font to specify the font file name to load. Does not yet go through the FTE filesystem, so cannot be in any pak files, and gamedirs are ignored. c:/windows/fonts/cour.ttf gives courier.
Most fonts seem to use 12 pixels as a minimum height for readability. FTE allows smaller, but you probably want vid_conautoscale to 1.5 (12/8 = 1.5), or greater, or vid_conheight set to some equivelent value.
Variable width fonts are supported, the width of the font ignores vid_conwidth.
^UXXXX can be used to print a unicode character on the console (capital U, lowercase is not recognised). U is hex between 0000 and ffff
If com_parseutf8 is set to 1, any text printed onto the console will be read as utf8 text. If there are any errors, parsing will be disabled until the next string.
in_builtincharmap can be set to 0 in order to get FTE to enter characters according to their system keyboard map (only required in windows).
The quake charset is mapped to ^Ue000 through ^Ue0ff.
^Ue100 upwards displays some hud images. This mechanism will likely change some time.
Links dynamically to FreeType. You can get a compatible version from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/freetype-bin-zip.php (freetype6.dll is the only file needed).
If you're compiling yourself and you have issues with FreeType2 dependancies, it can be disabled by tweeking bothdefs.h or by doing eg: 'make CFLAGS=-DNO_FREETYPE gl-rel'.
