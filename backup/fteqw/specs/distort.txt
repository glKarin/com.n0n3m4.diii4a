What is this?

Its a simple particle config with somewhat more complex (glsl) rendering effect.
Simply put, it'll distort the screen behind rockets and grenades.

To use, place the pk3 in your quake/fte/ dir.
Start up FTE.
r_particlesystem script
r_particlesdesc "spikeset tsshaft distort"

The second line will give you the default particle config, with the two replacement trails overriding the built in effects.

If you want to look at how its done, you can open the pk3 with winrar/7zip/winzip/windows explorer (if you change the filename extension). There are two text files inside. The effect could be adapted and applied to explosions and other stuff too. Enjoy.
