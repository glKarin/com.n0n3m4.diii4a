Description
======================================================================

This is a package of all the files from the Doom 3 Software Development Kit (SDK) that have been modified in the creation of Classic Doom 3.  The more predominant features of this code are the following:

-The intermission/statistics screen displayed between levels (there is an unused key/val combination that would allow mappers to update the GUI graphics depending the sequential progress of the player.  This was originally designed to facilitate a map on the intermission screen, but was dropped).

-Autorun.  A very small modification that simply checks the state of ui_autoRun and accordingly either flips input from the run key or leaves it untouched.


For a complete picture of what has been changed, cross-reference this code and the untouched 1.3.1 code using diff or a similar program for your operating system.
