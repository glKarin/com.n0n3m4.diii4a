To run iortcw on the Raspberry Pi requires SDL2 and at least 128M for GPU memory.

(Under Raspbian, you can set the GPU memory using the raspi-config tool under Advanced Options->Memory Split)

SDL2 will need to be built in a particular way to have hardware accelerated
graphics.

Download the SDL2 source code (2.0.3 at the time of this writing) from:

http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3.tar.gz

You will need to install the libudev development files for mouse support.
On the Raspbian distro, this is done by running the command:

sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

You will also need to disable x11 (software rendering) and opengl (not supported
on the Raspberry Pi.)

Unpack the SDL source and go into the source tree and issue the command:

./configure --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-opengl

Note: On the newer Raspberry Pi 2 (due to a change in the toolchain naming) use:

./configure --host=armv7l-raspberry-linux-gnueabihf --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-opengl

After that has completed, type:
make

If build completes successfully, type:
sudo make install


At this point you can go into the iortcw source tree and type:
./make-raspberry-pi.sh

Output binaries will be located in the 'build' directory, which you can copy
into your RTCW install directory.
