usage:
 see the file interface.txt for detailed explanation of how to call
 amp11lib functions from an application.

features:
 -all features of amp11 concerning decoding mpeg music files,
   streaming from http and playing on output
 -can play more than one stream at the same time, with built-in mixing
 -supports using more than one audio output device
 -easy to use simple library interface callable from any language
 -library compiling tested only with Visual C++ so far

comments/bugs/todos:
  -'makeunix' and 'makewc' are not currently valid, since have not 
   been tested yet
  -test on other compilers/systems
  -add support for equalizers
  -support for multiple audio output devices has not actually been 
     tested on multiple audio output devices at the same time yet :)

revision history:
  -al20010102:
   -added support for mp3s with id3v2 tags (the tags are now skipped correctly)
  -al20000318:
   -second thread uses multimedia timer on win32, that should solve
     most latency, skipping and blocking problems
   -customizable timer frequency
   -support for multiple audio output devices (not yet tested well)
  -al19991024:
   -first test version, not released

a word on amp11 and amp11lib:

  amp11lib is based on amp11 and its underlying mpxdec and binfile
  libraries. this is in fact an interface for binfile/decoder part 
  of amp11, and most comments/features that apply to amp11, apply 
  to this library too.
  it is intended to simplify incorporating decoding and playing of 
  mpeg audio files in different applications. currently, it is 
  beeing used for building a turn-tables-like-application with
  visual basic, and as a plug-in music player for a pc game still
  in development.
