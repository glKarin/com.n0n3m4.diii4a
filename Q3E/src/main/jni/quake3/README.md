The intent of this project is to provide a baseline engine which may be used
for further development and to play _Quake 3: Arena,_ _Team Arena,_ and mods.

Some of the major features currently implemented are:

  * CMake meta-build system
  * SDL 2 backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound
    quality)
  * Full x86_64 support on Linux
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble.
  * MinGW compilation support on Windows
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * Support for various esoteric operating systems
  * cl_guid support
  * Web server download redirection
  * Multiuser support on Windows systems (user specific game data
    is stored in "%APPDATA%\Quake3")
  * PNG support
  * Web support via Emscripten
  * Many, many bug fixes

The map editor and associated compiling tools are not included. We suggest you
use a modern copy from http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.

The original id software readme that accompanied the Q3 source release has been
renamed to id-readme.txt so as to prevent confusion. Please refer to the
website for updated status.

# Compilation and installation
**Note that for all of these platforms, if you want to play _Quake 3: Arena_ or 
the expansion pack, _Team Arena_, you'll still need to buy a copy of the game.**
The _Quake 3_ game source code is freely available under the GPLv2, not the game data.

You can get links to buy and support the project here: https://ioquake3.org/buy/


You can make your own mod that either requires the original game data or a new game  
that does not. Please read the **Creating standalone games** section for more information
on the latter.

For *nix,
  1. `git clone git://github.com/ioquake/ioq3.git`
  2. `cd ioq3`
  3. Install dependencies according to your operating system's instructions.  
     for apt-based systems, `sudo apt install cmake libsdl2-dev`
  4. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
  5. `cmake --build build`
  6. The resulting files will be in the `build` directory.

For Windows,
  1. Install Visual Studio Community Edition from Microsoft.
     https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
  2. Install CMake https://cmake.org/cmake/download
  3. Clone our git repository either using the command-line or a GUI tool:  
      `git clone git://github.com/ioquake/ioq3.git`
  4. Compile using Visual Studio by selecting our CMakeLists.txt and clicking Build.
  5. Or using the command-line: `cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`
  6. `cmake --build build --config Release`

For macOS,
  1. Install XCode.
  2. Install CMake via homebrew https://brew.sh or your package manager of choice.
  3. `git clone git://github.com/ioquake/ioq3.git`
  4. `cd ioq3`
  5. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
  6. `cmake --build build`
  7. Copy the resulting `ioquake3.app` in `/build/`
     to your `/Applications/ioquake3` folder.

For Emscripten,
  1. Follow the installation instructions for the Emscripten SDK including
     setting up the environment with emsdk_env. https://emscripten.org/
  2. `git clone git://github.com/ioquake/ioq3.git`
  3. `cd ioq3`
  4. `emcmake cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
  5. `cmake --build build`
  3. Copy or symlink your baseq3 pk3 files into the `build/Release/baseq3`
     directory so they can be loaded at run-time. Only game files listed in
     `client-config.json` will be loaded.
  4. Start a web server serving this directory. `python3 -m http.server`
     is an easy default that you may already have installed.
  5. Open `http://localhost:8000/build/Release/ioquake3.html`
     in a web browser. Open the developer console to see errors and warnings.
  6. Debugging the C code is possible using a Chrome extension. For details
     see https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020

Installation, for *nix
  1. Set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to your prefered installation directory.
     By default it will be set to /opt/quake3/.
  2. `cmake --install build`.

The following CMake variables may be set, using `-D` on the command line.

```
  BUILD_SERVER            - build the 'ioq3ded' server binary
  BUILD_CLIENT            - build the 'ioquake3' client binary
  BUILD_RENDERER_OPENGL1  - build the opengl1 client / renderer library
  BUILD_RENDERER_OPENGL2  - build the opengl2 client / renderer library
  BUILD_GAME_LIBRARIES    - build the game shared libraries
  BUILD_GAME_QVMS         - build the game qvms
  BUILD_STANDALONE        - build binaries suited for stand-alone games

  USE_RENDERER_DLOPEN     - build and use the renderer in a library
  USE_OPENAL              - use OpenAL where available
  USE_OPENAL_DLOPEN       - link with OpenAL at runtime
  USE_HTTP                - enable http download support
  USE_CODEC_VORBIS        - enable Ogg Vorbis support
  USE_CODEC_OPUS          - enable Ogg Opus support
  USE_MUMBLE              - enable Mumble support
  USE_VOIP                - enable built-in VoIP support
  USE_FREETYPE            - enable FreeType support for rendering fonts

  USE_INTERNAL_LIBS       - build internal libraries instead of dynamically
                            linking against system libraries; this just sets
                            the default for USE_INTERNAL_ZLIB etc.
  USE_INTERNAL_SDL        - link against internal SDL (if available)
  USE_INTERNAL_ZLIB       - build and link against internal zlib
  USE_INTERNAL_JPEG       - build and link against internal JPEG library

  USE_INTERNAL_VORBIS     - build and link against internal Vorbis library
  USE_INTERNAL_OPUS       - build and link against internal opus/opusfile libraries

  EMSCRIPTEN_PRELOAD_FILE - set to 1 to package 'baseq3' (BASEGAME) directory
                            containing pk3s and loose files as a single
                            .data file that is loaded instead of listing
                            individual files in client-config.json

  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE        - on single config CMake, set to Debug or Release
```

The defaults for these variables may differ depending on the target platform.


# OpenGL ES support

The opengl2 renderer (the default) supports OpenGL ES 2+. Though there
are many missing features and the performance may not be sufficient for
embedded System-on-a-Chip and mobile platforms.

The opengl1 renderer does not have OpenGL ES support.

The opengl2 renderer will try both OpenGL and OpenGL ES APIs to find one that
works. The `r_preferOpenGLES` cvar controls which API to try first.
Set it to -1 for auto (default), 0 for OpenGL, and 1 for OpenGL ES. It should be
set using command line arguments:

    ioquake3 +set cl_renderer opengl2 +set r_preferOpenGLES 1


# Filesystem

Compared to the original release, user configuration and data files are stored
in more modern locations. If you want a different behaviour a specific path
can be provided by adding `+set fs_homepath <path>` to the command line.

### Windows

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Quake3`

### macOS

`/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Quake3`

### Linux

`/home/<username>/.config/Quake3` Configuration files.
`/home/<username>/.local/share/Quake3` Data files (pk3s etc.).
`/home/<username>/.local/state/Quake3` Other internal runtime files.

These directories correspond to the Free Desktop XDG Base Directory
Specification. The original release used `/home/.q3a`. This will be used if
present, however in this case a prompt will be shown suggesting migration to
the above locations, if desired.

                                      supports values in the range of 0 to 1
  r_stereoEnabled                   - enable stereo rendering for techniques
                                      like shutter glasses (untested)

                                      red-green you probably want to enable

# README for Developers

## pk3dir

_ioquake3_ has a useful new feature for mappers. Paths in a game directory with
the extension ".pk3dir" are treated like pk3 files. This means you can keep
all files specific to your map in one directory tree and easily zip this
folder for distribution.

## 64bit mods

If you wish to compile external mods as shared libraries on a 64bit platform,
and the mod source is derived from the id Q3 SDK, you will need to modify the
interface code a little. Open the files ending in _syscalls.c and change
every instance of int to intptr_t in the declaration of the syscall function
pointer and the dllEntry function. Also find the vmMain function for each
module (usually in cg_main.c g_main.c etc.) and similarly replace the return
value in the prototype with intptr_t (arg0, arg1, ...stay int).

Add the following code snippet to q_shared.h:

```c
#ifdef Q3_VM
typedef int intptr_t;
#else
#include <stdint.h>
#endif
```

Note if you simply wish to run mods on a 64bit platform you do not need to
recompile anything since by default Q3 uses a virtual machine system.

## Creating mods compatible with Q3 1.32b

If you're using this package to create mods for the last official release of
Q3, it is necessary to pass the commandline option '-vq3' to your invocation
of q3asm. This is because by default q3asm outputs an updated qvm format that
is necessary to fix a bug involving the optimizing pass of the x86 vm JIT
compiler.

## Creating standalone games

Have you finished the daunting task of removing all dependencies on the Q3
game data? You probably now want to give your users the opportunity to play
the game without owning a copy of Q3, which consequently means removing cd-key
and authentication server checks. In addition to being a straightforward Q3
client, _ioquake3_ also purports to be a reliable and stable code base on which
to base your game project.

However, before you start compiling your own version of _ioquake3_, you have to
ask yourself: Have we changed or will we need to change anything of importance
in the engine?

If your answer to this question is "no", it probably makes no sense to build
your own binaries. Instead, you can just use the pre-built binaries on the
website. Just make sure the game is called with:

    +set com_basegame <yournewbase>

in any links/scripts you install for your users to start the game. The
binary must not detect any original quake3 game pak files. If this
condition is met, the game will set com_standalone to 1 and is then running
in stand alone mode.

If you want the engine to use a different directory in your homepaths than
"Quake3" then set a new name at startup by adding

    +set com_homepath <homedirname>

to the command line. You can also control which game name to use when talking
to the master server:

    +set com_gamename <gamename>

So clients requesting a server list will only receive servers that have a
matching game name.

Example line:

    +set com_basegame basefoo +set com_homepath foo
    +set com_gamename foo

If you really changed parts that would make vanilla ioquake3 incompatible with
your mod, we have included another way to conveniently build a stand-alone
binary. Edit /cmake/identity.cmake and run cmake with the option BUILD_STANDALONE=1.
Don't forget to edit the PRODUCT_NAME and subsequent #defines in qcommon/q_shared.h with
information appropriate for your project.

## Standalone game licensing

While a lot of work has been put into _ioquake3_ that you can benefit from free
of charge, it does not mean that you have no obligations to fulfill. Please be
aware that as soon as you start distributing your game with an engine based on
our sources we expect you to fully comply with the requirements as stated in
the GPL. That includes making sources and modifications you made to the
ioquake3 engine as well as the game-code used to compile the .qvm files for
the game logic freely available to everyone. Furthermore, note that the "QIIIA
Game Source License" prohibits distribution of mods that are intended to
operate on a version of Q3 not sanctioned by id software:

    "with this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right
    to distribute copies of the Software ... for operation only with the full
    version of the software game QUAKE III ARENA"

This means that if you're creating a standalone game, you cannot use said
license on any portion of the product. As the only other license this code has
been released under is the GPL, this is the only option.

This does NOT mean that you cannot market this game commercially. The GPL does
not prohibit commercial exploitation and all assets (e.g. textures, sounds,
maps) created by yourself are your property and can be sold like every other
game you find in stores.


## PNG support

ioquake3 supports the use of PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images as
textures. It should be noted that the use of such images in a map will
result in missing placeholder textures where the map is used with the id
Quake 3 client or earlier versions of ioquake3.

Recent versions of GtkRadiant and q3map2 support PNG images without
modification. However GtkRadiant is not aware that PNG textures are supported
by ioquake3. To change this behaviour open the file 'q3.game' in the 'games'
directory of the GtkRadiant base directory with an editor and change the
line:

    texturetypes="tga jpg"

to

    texturetypes="tga jpg png"

Restart GtkRadiant and PNG textures are now available.

## Building with MinGW for pre Windows XP

IPv6 support requires a header named "wspiapi.h" to abstract away from
differences in earlier versions of Windows' IPv6 stack. There is no MinGW
equivalent of this header and the Microsoft version is obviously not
redistributable, so in its absence we're forced to require Windows XP.
However if this header is acquired separately and placed in the qcommon/
directory, this restriction is lifted.


# Contributing

Please submit patches through GitHub pull requests.

The focus for ioq3 is to develop a stable base suitable for further development
and provide players with the same Quake 3 experience they've had for years.

We do have graphical improvements with the new renderer, but they are off by default.
See opengl2-readme.md for more information.
