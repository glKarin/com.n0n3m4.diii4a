Borzh mod is for labyrinth type mod.
The goal is to have bots to get to some predefined area of the labyrinth-type map.

You need to modify config.ini, so plugin recognize hl2dm mod folder as borzh mod.
Then add two bots on borzh-labyrinth or borzh-labyrinth-v2 map and say "start" to see them play.
My thesis is based on that.

You need to define BOTRIX_BORZH and BOTRIX_CHAT in project properties to use bots for Borzh Mod.
